# Impact 


The earth is asleep, snuggled beneath it's starry blanket, as it drifts through the darkness of the universe. I  hear it calling out to me. It's tendrils coiling around my ankles , pulling me down under...

## 300 milliseconds to impact :

My face is now 2 centimeters above the pavement. My eyes are closed. You might want to look away now because it's about to smash into the pavement, splattering my brains all over the concrete. Oh what a mess I've made. 

## 1.5 seconds to impact :
I'm suspended in mid air,relaxed , at ease, unaware of the painful bliss Im about to experience. Time has slowed down , and each heartbeat seems to span an eternity. Oh what have I done. 

## 3 seconds to impact :
My heart pounds away like a sledgehammer , as it tries to break out of my chest. I can't believe I actually did this ... 

## 4 seconds to impact :
Freedom . First there will be pain. Then freedom. And then, nothing. The end. Enough of this endless striving after nothing. 

## 5 seconds to impact :
It's so scary being up here. I've always been afraid of heights. 

## 5 minutes to impact :
I leave the phone on the table. I leave the door unlocked. There's an orange in the fridge. There's always time for an orange. 

## 10 minutes to impact :
I pick up my phone to write my final story. I have nothing profound to say. This won't be a master piece or anything.

I begin typing my story :

"The earth is asleep, snuggled beneath its starry blanket.. "
