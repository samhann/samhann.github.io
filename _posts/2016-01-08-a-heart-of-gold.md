Her eyes were set like ruins,  
That shone beneath a sea of stars,  
Her hair did smoke from ancient fires,  
With smolders of deep desires.  

Her laughter came in waves,   
So gently at first,  
And then the dam did burst,  
As waves of airy ecstasy,  
Just washed all over me.  

The lines criss cross her hands,   
Like roads on ancient lands,  
Across the ridge and valleys vast,  
Along the cities of the past,  
It lies upon her lap,  
That magic map,  
I chart my course and then depart,  
To find the treasure in her heart.
